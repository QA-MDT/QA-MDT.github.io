      </h2>
      <p class="abstract-text">
        <font color="000000"> In recent years, diffusion-based text-to-music (TTM) generation has gained prominence, offering a novel approach to synthesizing musical content from textual
          descriptions. Achieving high accuracy and diversity in this generation process
          requires extensive, high-quality data, which often constitutes only a fraction of
          available datasets. Within open-source datasets, the prevalence of issues like
          mislabeling, weak labeling, unlabeled data, and low-quality music waveform significantly hampers the development of music generation models. To overcome
          these challenges, we introduce a novel quality-aware masked diffusion transformer
          (QA-MDT) approach that enables generative models to discern the quality of input
          music waveform during training. Building on the unique properties of musical
          signals, we have adapted and implemented a MDT model for TTM task, while
          further unveiling its distinct capacity for quality control. Moreover, we address the
          issue of low-quality captions with a caption refinement data processing approach.</font>
